# [[Personal Project - ML to Go fast]]
- Creating custom erg score
	- Using rowing data (start with my own)
	- Generating exercise score for ergs
		> Illness/Injury prevention or test projections
		- Erg data output
		- Neural Network to score ergs
		- Some kind of fitness score, correlating different pieces of data
		- Using RPE/HR/Watts
		- Start w historical scoring, potentially generate realtime feedback
- Email:
- Using erg and personal health data (HR, potentially morning HRV)
- Using this data to either predict performance/suggest training plan adjustments
