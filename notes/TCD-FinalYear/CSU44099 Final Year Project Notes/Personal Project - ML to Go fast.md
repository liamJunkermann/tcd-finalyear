## People with brains
[Nick Mahony](https://peoplefinder.tcd.ie/Profile?Username=NJMAHONY) Asst Prof & MSc Sports Medicine Co-ordin (Anatomy)

## Information I lack
- The sports science details/minds to bounce this idea off

## General thoughts
- Whoop does their strain calculations entirely off heart rate, and does not allow you adjust zones beyond entering or calculating max heart rate. 
	- Trained athletes will have different zones so strain might be different, can a model have an optional parameter for lactate profiles which may enhance training?
- The basic idea would be, presumably there is a pattern between power output and heart rate, from there some conclusions can likely be drawn about how effective a session was (ideally steady state)

## Interesting references found along the way

## Meeting questions
- How will I be evaluated

## Meeting notes (Sept 20)
- Help to get good mark
- Communication of it is more key
- Weekly-ish meetings 30 min
- Project
	- Research Ethics (using peers for data)
		- Discussion at next meeting
	- Get Greedy about data, make sure people have the data available
	- How do I qualify data
	- Data collection pipeline
		- How to get it all smoothly
		- to report extra bits data entry
	- Clarify that this is individualised
	- Generating personalised feedback
	- ### Todos
		- In two weeks figure out data collection pipeline
			- Combination of APIs and forms
			- 
		- More literature in using machine learning to look at training outcomes
