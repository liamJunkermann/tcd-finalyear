> On this basis, the mathematical structure allows for a precise determination of optimal sequence of training doses that would enhance the greatest athletic performance, at a given time point.
> Through ensemble learning methods such as stacking, machine-learning approaches are not alternatives to Fitness-Fatigue models but rather a way to improve their predictive capability while preserving expert information in the modelling.

I need to find:
Banister, E. W., Calvert, T. W., Savage, M. V., & Bach, T. (1975). A systems model of training for athletic performance. Aust. J. Sports Med, 7, 57–61.
- this seems to be the basis for most of the TRIMP (Training Impulse Response) modelling thats started all this exercise modelling stuff
