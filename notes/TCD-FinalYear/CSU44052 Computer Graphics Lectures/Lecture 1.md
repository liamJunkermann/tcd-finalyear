## Assessment
Project (60%)
- Extend theory learned in lectures
Quizzes (40%)
First lab due week 3 (essentially intro lab)
Project Theme shown in week 4

## Visual Computing
Encompasses Graphics (Producing/Creating imagery and making it move), Vision, Visualisation, and Virtual Reality
Strong overlap between graphics and vision
### Computer Graphics
- Modelling
	- Creating or capturing the representation of objects without motion often geometrical
- Rendering (what we cover)
	- Creating an image of objects on display device (laptop screen, VR/AR goggles)
- Animation (very brief coverage)
	- Making these objects move by describing how they change over time
	- Covering solid body motion

Shading and Materials
- Lighting: Generation of maths for light source, material properties, etc
- Shading: Lighting maths for entire object/face, make it a bit more efficiently
	- Limits where lighting calculations are calculated to limited points then essentially guess the colour outcome
	- Different ways to calculate shades: 
		- Flat Shading (a simple and fast method to specify the color for an object)
		- Gouraud Shading (implemented to improve the smooth transitions of the color on round objects)
		- Phong Shading (an interpolation technique for surface shading)
