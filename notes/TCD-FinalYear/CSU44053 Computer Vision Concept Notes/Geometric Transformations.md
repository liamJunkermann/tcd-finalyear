# Geometric Transformations
## Problem Specification and Algorithm
Given a *distorted image* $f(i,j)$ and a *corrected image* $f'(i',j')$ we can model a geometric transformation between their coordinates as $i=T_i(i',j')$ and $j=T_j(i',j')$ that is given the coordinates $(i',j')$ in the *corrected image*, the functions $T_i()$ and $T_j()$ compute the corresponding coordinates $(i,j)$ in the *distorted image*.
