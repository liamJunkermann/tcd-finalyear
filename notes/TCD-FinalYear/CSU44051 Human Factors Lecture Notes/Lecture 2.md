## Evaluation of Prototype
- Get people to use it, and measuring success
## [[Cognition]]
> Heavily taken from Chapter Four of Interaction Design
### Attention
How difficult is the process
- How clear is the goal
- How clear in the environment information is
	- eg. information layout, density is not always a hinderance (goes back to understanding user, what they might need)
Designing for attention:
- Making information clear for a given task
- Using things like colour to highlight information
### Perception and Recognition
> How do we see or experience the things
- Information layout has an effect on how we perceive information
Layout
 - Consistent Layout
 - Grouping items
 - Whitespace
	 - Sweet spot between just enough and too much whitespace
Laws of gestalt
- Proximity
- Similarity
- Good Continuation
- Closure/Good Form
### Memory
- First we encode, then retrieve knowledge
- Can result in fallibility in memory
- Context is crucial to memory
	- eg. seeing a person out of context (someone you're used to seeing in hometown, seeing them elsewhere)
- Types of memory
	- Sensory
	- Longterm Memory (LTM)
		- Slower to access, we keep it for longer
		- Episodic - Serial Memory of Events
		- Semantic - structured memory of facts, concepts, skills
		- Semantic LTM derived from episodic LTM
		- Retrieval
			- Recall
				- Information reproduced from memory
			- Recognition (we want to design more w this, as its easier)
				- Information given by knowledge thats been seen before
	- Short term Memory (STM)
		- Scratchpad for short-term recall
		- 7 $\pm$ 2 Rule
			- No need to push this rule of 7 in design bc its there in front of a user

### Reading, Speaking, and Listening
