Name of Lead Researcher (student in case of project work): \textbf{\authorname}

Name of Supervisor: \textbf{Dr.~Lucy Hederman}

TCD Email: \textbf{\href{mailto:junkerml@tcd.ie}{junkerml@tcd.ie}} Contact Tel. No.: \textbf{+353 089 484 2123}

Course Name and Code (if applicable): \textbf{Integrated Computer Science }

Estimated Start Date of survey/research: \textbf{ASAP}

I confirm that I will (where relevant):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Familiarize myself with the Data Protection Act and the College Good Research Practice guidelines\newline\url{http://www.tcd.ie/info_compliance/dp/legislation.php}
    \item Tell participants that any recordings, e.g. audio/video/photographs, will not be identifiable unless prior written permission has been given. I will obtain permission for specific reuse (in papers, talks, etc.)
    \item Provide participants with an information sheet (or web page for web-based experiments) that describes the main procedures (a copy of the information sheet must be included with this application)
    \item Obtain informed consent for participation (a copy of the informed consent form must be included with this application)
    \item Should the research be observational, ask participants for their consent to be observed
    \item Tell participants that their participation is voluntary
    \item Tell participants that they may withdraw at any time and for any reason without penalty
    \item Give participants the option of omitting questions they do not wish to answer if a questionnaire is used
    \item Tell participants that their data will be treated with full confidentiality and that, if published, it will not be identified as theirs
    \item On request, debrief participants at the end of their participation (i.e. give them a brief explanation of the study)
    \item Verify that participants are 18 years or older and competent to supply consent.
    \item If the study involves participants viewing video displays then I will verify that they understand that if they or anyone in their family has a history of epilepsy then the participant is proceeding at their own risk
    \item Declare any potential conflict of interest to participants.
    \item Inform participants that in the extremely unlikely event that illicit activity is reported to me during the study I will be obliged to report it to appropriate authorities.
    \item Act in accordance with the information provided (i.e. if I tell participants I will not do something, then I will not do it).
\end{itemize}
